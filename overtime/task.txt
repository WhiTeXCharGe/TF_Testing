📌 Reminder Text (for solver design)

Token generation: For each task, create exactly workload_units tokens (not hours).

Per token hours: Each token has hours ∈ [1..12], chosen by solver.

Task equality (hard):

\sum_{\text{tokens of task}} \text{hours} = \text{workload_units} \times 8

One task per employee per day (hard).

Heads per task-day (hard): distinct employees with hours>0 must be within YAML staffing_per_task_per_day.min/max.

Employee daily cap (hard):

Objective (soft):

Minimize overtime.

Finish tasks earlier (prefer earlier days).

Balance workload across employees.
